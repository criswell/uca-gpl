* clientagent/steward/ccmsupdate.py, inside the CCMS_Update constructor there is
  a FIXME which points out that we still haven't solved the WDSL caching problem
  in the client agent. This means that the unified agent will not cache the WSDL
  from CCMS, and that if we proceed into production as-is we very likely will
  overwhelm (DoS) the CCMS server with our requests. There is a way to turn on
  caching in SUDS, but we do not yet have that enabled.
