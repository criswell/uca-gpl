* clientagent/steward/ccmsupdate.py, inside the CCMS_Update constructor there is
  a FIXME which points out that we still haven't solved the WDSL caching problem
  in the client agent. This means that the unified agent will not cache the WSDL
  from CCMS, and that if we proceed into production as-is we very likely will
  overwhelm (DoS) the CCMS server with our requests. There is a way to turn on
  caching in SUDS, but we do not yet have that enabled.

* Need to restore non-priv user security restrictions under Linux again. See
  FIXME in platform-specific/linux/dispatcher/lib/dispatcher.sh on line 9.

* Do something less "frightening looking" with uca-bootstrap when normal/
  expected things (like home not being there when we do a fresh install)
  happen.

* Need update logic, for bootstrap (old bootstrap) to check for updates and if
  present will switch to UCA, but only if Python is present on system (e.g.,
  XenClient support).
