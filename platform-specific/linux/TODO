* The build environment needs MASSIVE re-working here. It currently builds a
  lot we do not need. For example, it has the build deps and source for gsoap.
  Basically, a re-write using virtual-env would be the way to go.

* The makefiles will need to be fixed. Currently they depend on a lot of
  things specific to the LCA, but if all we need is the script elevator, those
  dependencies drop to practically nothing.

* The dispatcher scripts will need to be tweaked to work with the new UCA.
  Most importantly, the entire install and init process will have to be
  tweaked. For example, the elevate script tool will now need to be used in
  init as we're running a script as EIL.EIL user/group.
