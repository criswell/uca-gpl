* The build environment needs MASSIVE re-working here. It currently builds a
  lot we do not need. For example, it has the build deps and source for gsoap.
  Basically, a re-write using virtual-env would be the way to go.

* The makefiles will need to be fixed. Currently they depend on a lot of
  things specific to the LCA, but if all we need is the script elevator, those
  dependencies drop to practically nothing.
